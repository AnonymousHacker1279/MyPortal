    <h2>Unfortunately, Anonymous Websites has shut down.</h2>
    <br />
    <div class="container">
    <p>The reason for this is because CenturyLink has prevented an Apache web server from running on their network. CenturyLink is an Internet Service Provider that has their own paid Apache services. We used a free one (Apache is licensed under the Apache License, giving the freedom to modify, distribute, and use for free while preserving copyright notice and disclaimer). CenturyLink blocked our server ports to prevent external access (to save bandwidth, saving them money).</p>
    <p>It is unlikely that this website will be opened again. However, in the near future, it may be possible.</p>

        <h3>About Anonymous Websites</h3>
        <br />
        <p>Anonymous Websites was a web portal that provided many services to the 300+ users. It had tutorials, games, and web proxies. It's development team consisted of two members that worked after and sometimes during school (those members were only teenagers that were 13).</p>

        <p>The portal was a way for the developers to practice their programming skills, and to show them to everyone (anonymously, though we had GitHub names in the credits). We enjoyed a small user base, and we were told multiple times that the website was one of the ones they most used while at school.</p>
