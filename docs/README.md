# Welcome to MyPortal!

MyPortal allows users to work together easily. Files can be moved across devices with relative ease, and multiple web apps allow for ease in collaboration.

### What does MyPortal provide?

As of right now, MyPortal has four web apps. The web apps are designed with a core task in mind. Each app provides a different function.

The four apps we have right now are:

* File Manager - Allows files to be uploaded/downloaded, and managed online
* Rich Text Editor - Provides features to help you make beautiful documents, and within your browser. It saves to the default File Manager directory. It has all the features you need, right from CKEditor.
* Code Editor - Helps you edit and create code with ease in your browser. Because it is powered by the Ace engine, you can easily make powerful programs.
* TeamChat - Lets teams talk to each other in a chatroom. People won't need to be in the same room to communicate, since it is powered by the ScaleDrone API.

More apps are in the works and will be added at a later time.

### Why was MyPortal made?

I [AnonymousHacker1279] have a reason behind it.

  I do a lot of programming and engineering. I even have my own small workshop (and I'm only a teen). I tend to move between my workshop and my house. However, when I am in my workshop, I don't get a good internet connection because I'm about 150 feet away from my pitiful router. I didn't want to move my documents across with a flash drive, because it would be too cumbersome. I can't use cloud storage either because of the loading times (between my poor upload speed of 0.2 megabits per second and distance from router). Because of all this, I decided to make my own. I only knew some HTML and CSS, but I figured I would be able to learn new languages by making my own program. I probably used hundreds of online guides, but I ended up getting a bare-bones server after some time. I don't have anything special for hosting the pages, just a Raspberry Pi Zero W (about $15). I started to learn PHP, and that let me add more complex features, like a page to allow users to login/sign up. I built on that and ended up with a few web apps. 
  
  Now, I continue to add more as I learn more languages. I'm sure that many other aspiring innovators have had issues like this, and I hope this program will help. If it doesn't, change it to make it work your own way. It's completely open source. Your features might even become mainstream one day, if you want them to.
